  <h2>Step 1: Take a Deep Breath</h2>
  <p>
    Losing at pickleball can feel shocking, especially when you were “definitely winning”
    up until the score proved otherwise.
  </p>

  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Counting to ten is effective. Counting to eleven is suspiciously competitive.
  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: Accept Reality (Briefly)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“Good game.”</li>
    <li>“Nice shots.”</li>
    <li>“Yeah, you played well today.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Do Not Blame the Paddle</h2>
  <p>Paddles do not lose pop. Players lose patience.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Complaining about a $200 paddle reduces credibility by 73%.
